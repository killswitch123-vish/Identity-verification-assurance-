Finding 1: Incomplete Notes

Findings - Some calls had incomplete notes, and not all verification steps were documented.

Impact - This can cause compliance issues and makes it harder for staff to understand past interactions.

Recommendation - Provide remainder or a quick training for staff to complete the full notes and record verification steps clearly.

Finding 2: Missed Verification

Findings - Some calls were not fully verified, and the complete identity check wasn’t always followed.

Impact - This increases the risk of unauthorised access and potential fraud.

Recommendation - Provide regular reminders or short refresher training to staff on the full verification steps. QA feedback can be used to support this and highlight areas that need improvement

Finding 3: Email sent to wrong Email address

Findings - Some emails were sent to the wrong email address, which indicates inconsistent checking before sending information.

Impact - This can lead to compliance issues and breaches of confidentiality.

Recommendation - Provide refreshers on verifying contact details before sending emails. QA feedback can support this by highlighting cases where contact details were not double-checked.
