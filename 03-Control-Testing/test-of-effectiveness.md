# Test of Effectiveness (ToE)

This section evaluates whether the control is performed effectively in practice.

## 🔐 Privacy Risk — ToE
From experience, staff usually follow verification steps before sharing information.  
However, documentation is sometimes incomplete, impacting auditability.

---

## 💳 Fraud Risk — ToE
Staff typically confirm identity before making changes.  
Occasional missed notes reduce control effectiveness.
