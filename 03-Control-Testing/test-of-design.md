# Test of Design (ToD)

This section evaluates whether the control is designed effectively.

---

## 🔐 Privacy Risk — ToD
The identity verification steps are clearly documented and easy for staff to follow.  
The design is strong because it requires verification before sharing information.

---

## 💳 Fraud Risk — ToD
Identity verification must be completed before any changes are made.  
The design prevents impersonation and reduces fraud risk.

---

## ⭐ Reputational Risk — ToD
The process requires staff to document all interactions and verification steps.  
This supports a complete audit trail and protects the organisation’s reputation.
