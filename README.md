# 📌 Identity Verification Assurance Review

A complete operational assurance review assessing the effectiveness of customer identity-verification controls.  
This project demonstrates practical GRC skills across risk assessment, control mapping, testing, findings, and remediation planning.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Identity verification is a critical first-line control used to confirm a customer’s identity before any information is shared or changes are made.  
This assurance review evaluates:

- Whether the process is designed effectively (Test of Design – ToD)  
- Whether the control works as intended in practice (Test of Effectiveness – ToE)  
- Risks arising from gaps in execution  
- Recommendations to strengthen control performance  

---

## 🧩 Objectives

This review was conducted to:

- Assess privacy, fraud, and reputational risks linked to identity-verification failures  
- Evaluate the design and operational effectiveness of the control  
- Identify gaps in documentation, process adherence, and assurance  
- Provide actionable recommendations to uplift control maturity

## 🚨 Key Risks Identified

### **1. Privacy Risk**
Unauthorised individuals may obtain personal information if verification is incomplete.

### **2. Fraud Risk**
Impersonation can lead to fraudulent changes, financial loss, or account misuse.

### **3. Reputational Risk**
Incorrect verification erodes customer trust and can damage organisational credibility.

## 🛡️ Controls Assessed

| Risk Type | Control |
|----------|---------|
| **Privacy Risk** | Identity must be verified using standard verification questions before sharing information. |
| **Fraud Risk** | No account changes occur until full verification is completed. |
| **Reputational Risk** | Staff must follow verification procedures and maintain a complete audit trail. |

## 🧪 Control Testing Results

### **Test of Design (ToD)**
- Verification steps are well-defined, structured, and easy to follow.  
- The design supports privacy protection and fraud prevention.  
- Documentation requirements create a clear audit trail.

### **Test of Effectiveness (ToE)**
- Controls are generally followed in practice.  
- However, documentation is inconsistent, and verification steps are sometimes missed.  
- These gaps reduce overall control effectiveness.

---

## 📎 Findings & Recommendations

### **1. Incomplete Notes**
- **Impact:** Weak auditability and potential compliance gaps  
- **Recommendation:** Refresher training on complete documentation

### **2. Missed Verification Steps**
- **Impact:** Higher risk of unauthorised access and fraud  
- **Recommendation:** Reinforce mandatory verification via training + QA feedback loops

### **3. Incorrect Email Address Verification**
- **Impact:** Confidentiality breaches and misdirected communication  
- **Recommendation:** Re-emphasise email-verification steps before sending information

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- Control design evaluation (ToD)  
- Control effectiveness testing (ToE)  
- Root-cause analysis  
- Writing assurance findings  
- Recommending risk-appropriate remediation  
- GRC documentation & audit-style reporting

## 📘 Summary

This assurance review demonstrates a practical and realistic evaluation of identity-verification controls.  
The design of the process is strong, but operational effectiveness can be uplifted through:

- Targeted staff training  
- More consistent documentation  
- Stronger QA feedback cycles  

These improvements significantly reduce privacy, fraud, and reputational risks.
