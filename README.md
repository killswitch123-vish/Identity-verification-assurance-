Identity Verification Assurance Review

An operational assurance review assessing how effectively an organisation verifies customer identity before performing any actions or sharing information. This review evaluates risks, controls, and both the Test of Design (ToD) and Test of Effectiveness (ToE) relating to identity verification.

1. Purpose of This Review

Identity verification ensures we are interacting with the correct and authorised customer before sharing information or making account changes.
This process protects:
Customer privacy
Financial security
Regulatory compliance
Organisational reputation

2. Why Identity Verification Exists

Identity verification helps prevent:

Unauthorised account access
Misuse of personal information
Fraudulent actions
Privacy breaches
Loss of customer trust
It ensures the organisation follows proper controls and maintains confidentiality.

3. Key Risks
   
Privacy Risk
If verification fails, an unauthorised person may access sensitive personal information, leading to a privacy breach.

Fraud Risk
A caller could impersonate the customer and make fraudulent changes to the account.

Reputational Risk
Identity-verification failures can reduce customer trust and damage the organisation’s reputation.

4. Controls Evaluated
   
Privacy Risk – Control
Customer identity must be fully verified using standard verification questions before providing information.

Fraud Risk – Control
No account changes can be made until identity verification is completed.

Reputational Risk – Control
Staff must follow the verification steps and document all interactions clearly to create an audit trail.

5. Test of Design (ToD)
   
Privacy Risk – ToD
The verification steps are clearly documented and require verification before any information is shared. Strong control design.

Fraud Risk – ToD
Documentation clearly requires identity verification before any changes. Good design prevents impersonation.

Reputational Risk – ToD
The design requires full documentation and verification before providing information. Good design for audit trail and accountability.

6. Test of Effectiveness (ToE)
   
Privacy Risk – ToE
Staff generally complete verification before sharing information, but some notes are missed.

Fraud Risk – ToE
Staff normally verify identity before making changes; however, documentation gaps impact audit completeness.

Reputational Risk – ToE
Verification usually happens, but incomplete notes reduce audit trail quality.

7. Findings
   
Finding 1: Incomplete Notes
Impact: Weak audit trail and potential compliance issues.
Recommendation: Provide reminders or refresher training to ensure full verification steps are always recorded.

Finding 2: Missed Verification
Impact: Risk of unauthorised access or fraud.
Recommendation: More regular refresher training + QA feedback to improve consistency.

Finding 3: Emails Sent to Incorrect Addresses
Impact: Confidentiality breaches and regulatory risk.
Recommendation: Staff must verify contact details before sending sensitive information; reinforce through QA feedback.

8. Summary

This assurance review highlights the importance of strong identity verification controls.
While the  control design is strong, its effectiveness can be improved through:
    -Better staff training
    -Stronger documentation habits
    -More consistent QA feedback
    
These improvements reduce privacy, fraud, and reputational risks
