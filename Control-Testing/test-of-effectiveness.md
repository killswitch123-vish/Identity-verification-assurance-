Based on my experience, the control is followed most of the time. Staff usually complete the verification before sharing information, but sometimes notes are missed

From my experience, staff normally follow this control. Changes are only made after identity is confirmed. But sometimes notes can be missed which affects the audit trail.

Reputational Risk

From my experience, staff usually follow the verification steps and document the call. But sometimes notes can be incomplete, which can affect the audit trail.
